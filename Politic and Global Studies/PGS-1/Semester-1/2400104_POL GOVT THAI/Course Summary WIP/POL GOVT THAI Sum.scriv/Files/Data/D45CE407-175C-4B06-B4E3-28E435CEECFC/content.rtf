\f0\fs24 \cf0 This summary book is the result of my study group member\'92s work, and I couldn\'92t make it without these persons: Mr. Pawat Kurovat, Mr. Chalongraj Bangwatana, Mr. Napat Korsincharoen, and Ms. Anchalika Akkarawibonkij.\
During our pre\'96examination preparation, we divided chapters among the members, each study, and take turn to teach each other. This method ensures that we understand the concept of each chapter to a certain degree. And as the result, this book has been created.\
