The "Great Divergence" refers to the widening gap in economic prosperity, technology, and living standards that emerged between the Western world and much of Asia, Africa, and Latin America from the late 18th century onwards\'97a process deeply linked to colonialism, industrialization, evolving models of economic growth, and the long shadows they cast on global inequality. This chapter examines the foundational growth models (Malthusian, Smithian, Solow, endogenous growth), the mechanics and regional cases of industrialization, the historical roots and institutional legacies of colonialism, wage and consumption dynamics, technology and sustainable development, the racial and ideological foundations of imperialism, the construction of colonial education systems, and contemporary globalization's entanglement with persistent inequality. Where appropriate, tables compare economic models, wage and consumption data, and summarize colonial impacts}
