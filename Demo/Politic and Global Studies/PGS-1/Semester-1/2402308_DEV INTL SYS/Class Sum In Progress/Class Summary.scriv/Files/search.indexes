            <Title>Historical–Contextual Eurocentrism</Title>
            <Text>Historical–Contextual Eurocentrism

The Historical–Contextual Eurocentrism focuses on the historical context of European dominance, its development, and how historical narratives have been shaped to favor European achievements and perspectives. It often emphasises the unique development of European societies, particularly in terms of rationality and progress.
	•	Marxist Rationality Argument belongs to his school of Eurocentrism.
	•	Superiority and emphasis of Greco–Roman dominance and inheritance is also part of this arguement.
	⁃	I.e., Rome is the only great empire and all else must be compared to Rome.</Text>

            <Text>Smith's Model of Economic Progress
	Adam Smith’s growth model, articulated in The Wealth of Nations (1776), stressed the transformative power of the division of labour, the extent of the market, and capital accumulation. Unlike Malthus, Smith believed that productivity could rise with scale, specialization, and institutional development:
	•	Division of labour: Specialization increases productivity (e.g., pin factory example), but is limited by the "extent of the market."
	•	Market expansion: Larger and more connected markets allow for further specialization and innovation.
	•	Capital accumulation: Savings and investment increase the stock of productive assets, fueling future growth</Text>

	Endogenous growth theory, particularly Paul Romer’s model (1990), internalizes technological progress by focusing on human capital, R&amp;D, and knowledge spillovers:
	•	Ideas are non-rival: One person’s use of an idea does not preclude another’s. Thus, research and innovation produce increasing returns at the aggregate level.
	•	Positive externalities: Firms/factories benefit from each other's innovations (knowledge spillovers), creating social returns greater than private ones</Text>

            <Title>Conclusion: Lessons and Policy Insights</Title>
            <Text>	The long arc of the Great Divergence and its associated phenomena—colonialism, industrialization, and globalization—has left indelible imprints on world inequality. Key takeaways:
	•	Historical growth models (Malthusian, Smithian, Solow, Romer) provide necessary lenses for interpreting global economic trajectories and understanding why some societies broke free of stagnation while others remained mired in poverty.
	•	Colonial expansion and deindustrialization created lasting disparities in institutions, education systems, and trade structures, fostering persistent gaps in income and opportunity.
	•	Technological change is indispensable for development but must be harnessed inclusively to avoid sharpening divides.
	•	Racial and ideological legacies shape not only policies of the past but the structures of present-day societies—from who controls capital and land, to who enjoys educational and political rights.
	•	Globalization connects, but also divides—reflecting colonial legacies in trade, education, and culture.
For progress toward equality and sustainable development:
	•	Invest in universal, relevant education and skill-building.
	•	Foster institutions that protect rights, encourage innovation, and distribute political and economic power widely.
	•	Design technology and globalization policies that prioritize inclusion, sustainability, and local agency.

Non-Fiction Standard Manuscript Format by A. Nonomusse

Foreword
Non-fiction works often feature a foreword or preface. This usually comes after the table of contents, but not always—sometimes the foreword precedes the table of contents. If you need your foreword to come before the table of contents, place the “Contents” document after “Foreword” in the Manuscript folder. You can also rename “Foreword” to "Preface" or "Introduction", or delete it entirely, depending on your requirements.
The table of contents is generated using Scrivener's Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as ToC feature. Simply select the documents in the binder that you want to include in your table of contents, select "Copy Documents as ToC" from the Edit &gt; Copy Special menu, and then hit Edit &gt; Paste (cmd-V) in the "Contents" document. The results won't look much in Scrivener's editor—a bunch of linked text with "&lt;$p&gt;" page number tags after it—but when compiled this will become a proper table of contents using the correct chapter titles. Remember to update your table of contents if you move, add, delete or rename any chapters.

Chapter One
Folder Names Become Subtitles
Standard manuscript format is often required for novels so that work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors to estimate word count and determine roughly how many pages will be required to produce a book using the page size, style and font used by their house.1 This PDF file was generated using Scrivener's Compile feature and was created using the “General Non-Fiction” project template.
Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate title page. The author's name, address, telephone number and e-mail address should be shown in the upper-left corner of the title page, single-spaced. The title of the work should appear about half-way down the page. The author's name follows the title on the by-line as the author wants it to appear when published. A real name or pseudonym may be used and may include initials, actual given name or professional designation.
A table of contents and foreword, preface or introduction may follow the title page, preceding the main text.
All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with a ragged right margin.
Nonomusse / NON-FICTION MS / 2
Paragraphs should be indented by about five spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional blank line. (It used to be traditional to separate each sentence with two spaces, but in these days of word processors this is now less common.) A 12-point font such as Courier, Times New Roman or Arial should be used throughout. In Scrivener, however, you can write using any font and formatting you choose —the Compile options can be used to change the formatting in the final document. In the “General Non-Fiction” project template, the Compile settings will deal with changing the font and formatting to those required for standard manuscript format.
Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each page except for the title page should include a header comprising the author's real surname, the title of the work (or a key word from the title) in capitals, and the page number. In Scrivener, all of this is handled by the Compile settings.
#
Section breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do not simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by the typesetter. In general, this will be handled by Compile in Scrivener,
however, so that you can either leave empty lines in the text (and Scrivener will insert the hash character during Compile) or use different documents for different sections (and Scrivener will add the hash between them).
Some editors and publishers prefer emphasis to be indicated by underlining rather than italics. In Scrivener, this conversion can be handled by Compile. The “General Non- Fiction (Courier)” Compile format will convert italics to underlines, whereas the “General Non-Fiction (Times)” format will not.
Nonomusse / NON-FICTION MS / 3
Chapter Two Another Chapter Folder
Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the chapter number about a third of the way down the page. In Scrivener, all of this is handled automatically by the “General Non- Fiction” compile formats.
Although it is often said that writers should not use the word-count features of their computers to determine the number of words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will happily accept a word processor word count these days. In Scrivener, you can insert a word count of your manuscript by using Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count (for a manuscript, you may wish to have the word count rounded to the nearest 100, in which case select Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count &gt; Rounded To Nearest 100—this feature is used on the title page of this manuscript, in fact). Note that the actual word count will not be inserted, but a tag that will be substituted for the word count upon export.
#
Footnotes should generally be numbered sequentially throughout the manuscript and appear
as endnotes at the very end.2 However, different editors and publishers have different
Nonomusse / NON-FICTION MS / 4
requirements when it comes to footnotes, so you should always check the submission guidelines.3
In reality, the formatting of a manuscript is often only really crucial when submitting directly to a publisher—first time authors will usually submit to an agent first, and agents are often less picky about format and will point you in the right direction before submitting your work to a publisher.

Endnotes
1. Much of the information contained in this document is based on a description of novel manuscript format by Matt Carless for the BBC Writers' Room website (http:// www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom), along with various web resources describing non-fiction manuscript format (the basics of standard manuscript format is commonly used for both fiction and non-fiction).
2. Useful information about non-fiction manuscript formatting was also taken from this web page: http://calemccaskey.blogspot.com/2011/05/how-to-prepare-non-fiction- manuscript.html
3. Note that if you require more advanced footnote and endnote layout, or if you require indexes, you should compile to RTF or Word format and open the generated file in your word processor of choice for a final pass.

            <Title>Core Dynamics of the Malthusian Regime</Title>
            <Text>Core Dynamics of the Malthusian Regime

	The Malthusian model, named after Thomas Robert Malthus's 1798 work, is foundational to understanding pre-industrial economic stagnation. It centers on a simple but powerful equilibrium mechanism: any increase in living standards (real income per capita), whether due to fortuitous events or incremental technological progress, leads to population growth. As population expands, diminishing returns in agricultural productivity drive real incomes back to subsistence. Thus, living standards remain stagnant over time, oscillating around a low equilibrium.
The classical formulation can be summarized as follows:
	•	Positive relationship: higher income per person raises birth rates and lowers mortality, spurring population growth.
	•	Negative relationship: rising population depresses per capita income (due to fixed land and slow technological change), which, in turn, checks further population increases via higher mortality.</Text>

This refers to the lingering effects of Eurocentric views that persist even in contemporary thought and practices. It can manifest in subtle ways, influencing policies and attitudes even when there is a conscious effort to move beyond Eurocentric frameworks.
	•	Holding European standards as universalist views and perspectives.
	•	Example: Mainstream theories in international relations often reflect Eurocentric assumptions about state behavior, sovereignty, and international norms, which may not be applicable or relevant to non–European contexts. This can limit the field’s ability to account for diverse geopolitical realities.

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>The "Great Divergence" refers to the widening gap in economic prosperity, technology, and living standards that emerged between the Western world and much of Asia, Africa, and Latin America from the late 18th century onwards—a process deeply linked to colonialism, industrialization, evolving models of economic growth, and the long shadows they cast on global inequality. This report provides a concise, accessible synthesis suitable for an educational book and slide deck, drawing on recent scholarship, official datasets, and key historical analyses. It is organized in ten chapters mirroring the original uploaded presentation: examining foundational growth models (Malthusian, Smithian, Solow, endogenous growth), the mechanics and regional cases of industrialization, the historical roots and institutional legacies of colonialism, wage and consumption dynamics, technology and sustainable development, the racial and ideological foundations of imperialism, the construction of colonial education systems, and contemporary globalization's entanglement with persistent inequality. Where appropriate, tables compare economic models, wage and consumption data, and summarize colonial impacts</Text>

            <Text>What is Colonialism?
Colonialism is a distinct mode of domination that involves the extended subjugation and political control of one people by another, typically manifesting through a foreign power establishing direct sovereignty, settling populations, and enforcing legal, economic, and social hierachies in the colonised territory.</Text>

            <Text>Mechanisms and Limitations
	Smith's model embodies a positive feedback loop:
	1.	More capital → more output
	2.	Higher output/income → larger market
	3.	Expanded market → more specialization and innovation
	4.	Specialization feeds both productivity and the development of new machinery
	However, Smith's model also recognizes that institutional structures and market access are crucial—state policies, political stability, and secure property rights foster the accumulation and deployment of capital.
Smithian Model Elements
Description
Production function
Output = f(Labor, Land, Capital)
Returns to scale
Increasing, due to division of labour
Growth drivers
Division of labour, market extent, capital accumulation
Population dynamics
Responsive to wages; lower than in Malthus’s model
Institutional context
Property rights, legal security, easy commerce

            <Text>Empirical Evidence: Wages, Life Expectancy, and Mortality
	Available wage and demographic data corroborate Malthus's predictions. Before 1800, real wages were flat or declining despite occasional technological advances, and life expectancy remained low (20–40 years, with high infant and child mortality)6.
Parameter
Pre-1750 Levels
Notes
Technological Innovation
Low
Innovations sporadic, poorly diffused
Productivity

Predominantly subsistence farming
Population Growth
Very slow
Zero or near-zero net growth over centuries
Mortality
High

While these trends held globally before the Industrial Revolution, regional heterogeneity did exist: certain parts of China, India, and the Islamic world experienced temporary clusters of higher productivity and urbanization, but these gains rarely broke the Malthusian ceiling for long.

            <Text>Transition from Malthusian to Modern Growth
	Modern growth began when societies escaped the Malthusian trap: industrialization, institutional reform, and faster technological change enabled sustained per capita income growth for the first time in history.
In Britain, for instance, the transition is evident in:
	•	Flat real wages from the Middle Ages to ~1800; surging after.
	•	Population surges initially lowered wages (Malthusian effect), but subsequent technological progress then increased both wages and population—a signature of the Solow regime.
	•	Land’s economic significance plummeted; capital and knowledge took center stage.

            <Text>GENERAL NON-FICTION

About This Template
When compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format used for many types of non-fiction. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an EPUB or Kindle ebook.

How To Use This Template
	•	Inside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
	⁃	Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.
	•	Create a new text document for each section inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, sections will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format, or with a blank line for other formats.)
	•	If you don’t require a foreword, move the “Foreword” document to the Trash folder. Alternatively, rename it “Preface” or “Introduction” if you prefer.
	•	“Notes” and “Ideas” folders have been provided for your convenience, although you can replace them or create different top-level folders for your research materials if necessary (these are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature).

Tables and Figures
If you need to use tables or figures in your manuscript, you can label them using the following tags, replacing “KEYWORD” with a unique word that identifies your table or figure.

!fig(KEYWORD)
!table(KEYWORD)

These tags will be replaced with numbers in the compiled document, with the numbering stream for figures being separate from the numbering stream for tables.

You can refer to such tags as follows:

#fig(KEYWORD)
#table(KEYWORD)

Here’s an example:

Table !table(sales): Sales 2011
Table !table(dates): Shipment dates
Figure !fig(skeleton): The skeleton of the gnu.
Figure !fig(malcolmreynolds): The second coolest character in Firefly.

… (For sales figures, see table #table(sales))… For shipment dates, see table #table(dates)… where he discovered the skeleton of a gnarled gnu (see figure #fig(skeleton))… Chronicles providing a similar role, albeit without the Castle actor (see figure #fig(malcolmreynolds)).

In the compiled document, the above text would look like this:

Table 1: Sales 2011
Table 2: Shipment dates
Figure 1: The skeleton of the gnu.
Figure 2: The second coolest character in Firefly.

… (For sales figures, see table 1)… For shipment dates, see table 2… where he discovered the skeleton of a gnarled gnu (see figure 1)… Chronicles providing a similar role, albeit without the Castle actor (see figure 2).

Compiling
	•	Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder. Different front matter is used for different formats.
	•	A “Back Matter” folder is also provided. Here you can add any back matter that is specific to each Compile format. Currently this only contains documents for storying endnotes (see below).
	•	Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference panel and have it open alongside the Compile panel if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.

	•	To compile to standard manuscript format:
	◦	Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use information from Contacts).
	◦	To create your table of contents:
	⁃	Holding down the Command key, select all the documents you wish to be included in the contents listing. (Usually this will be “Foreword” and all chapter folders, but not the individual sections inside chapter folders. If you have footnotes and wish them to be added to the end of the manuscript as endnotes, you should also include the “Endnotes” document inside “Back Matter”.)
	⁃	Go to Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as ToC.
	⁃	Paste into the “Contents” document in the “Manuscript Format” front matter folder. (Tip: Use Format &gt; Font &gt; Underline to change or remove the dotted underline between the chapter names and page numbers.)
	⁃	The resulting linked text and page number tags will be replaced with the final chapter names and page numbers in the compiled document.
	⁃	Note that you don’t need to do this every time you compile, only when chapters have been added, deleted, renamed or moved around. (Note to Microsoft Word users: If you export to Word, you may need to generate a print preview in Word to force the page numbers to show up correctly - they may appear as question marks before doing so.)
	⁃	You don’t have to use “Copy Documents as ToC” to create a table of contents, by the way. You could equally construct one yourself using document links and placeholders - see “List of All Placeholders…” in the Help menu for more information on the latter.
	◦	Go to File &gt; Compile…
	◦	Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.
	◦	Select either “Non-Fiction Manuscript (Courier)” or “Non-Fiction Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left.
	◦	Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
	◦	If you have footnotes in your text, they can either be included at the end of each page (the default) or as endnotes. To have them included as endnotes:
	⁃	Beneath the list of documents on the right side of the Compile pane, tick “Add back matter”. This will include the “Endnotes” document from the Back Matter/Manuscript Format folder.
	⁃	Click on the gear icon in the right-most header bar in Compile.
	⁃	Tick “Export inspector footnotes as endnotes” and “Export inline footnotes as endnotes”.
	◦	Click on “Compile”.

•	To compile to paperback PDF format:
	◦	Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.
	◦	Follow the instructions under compiling for standard manuscript format for creating a table of contents, but this time paste the contents list into the Front Matter/Paperback/Contents document.
	◦	Go to File &gt; Compile…
	◦	Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.
	◦	Select “Paperback (5.06” x 7.81”)” from the list of formats on the left.
	◦	Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it if it. (This has already been set up for you.)
	◦	If you have footnotes in your text, they can either be included at the end of each page or as endnotes. See the instructions under compiling for standard manuscript format for information on how to include footnotes as endnotes (in this case, however, clicking “Add Back Matter” will include the “Paperback” back matter folder).
	◦	Click on “Compile”.

	•	To compile to ebook format:
	◦	Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
	◦	Import a cover image (preferably in JPG or PNG format).
	⁃	You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “Ebook” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
	⁃	Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels, based on Amazon’s recommended size and proportions for a Kindle cover at the time this template was created.
	◦	Go to File &gt; Compile…
	◦	From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.
	⁃	To create an ePub file, choose the “ePub 3” format.
	⁃	To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle KF8/Mobi” format.
	⁃	“ePub 2” and “Kindle Mobi” are older versions of the formats. They are mainly provided for supporting projects created in older versions of Scrivener.
	◦	Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.
	◦	If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
	◦	Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:
	⁃	Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.
	⁃	Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.
	◦	Click on “Compile”.

Adding Sub-Heads
If you want your chapters divided into sections that each have their own sub-headings, simply use blank file groups for each heading, with each section under that heading a subdocument of the file group, like this:

Customising the Ebook Table of Contents
When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:
	1.	Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.
	2.	Name the document “Contents”.
	3.	In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Command to select more than one document).
	4.	For a simple flat list, hit Cmd-C or use Edit &gt; Copy. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, go to Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List.
	5.	Click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Cmd-V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.
	6.	If you intend to export to an older ebook format (ePub 2 or non-KF8 Mobi), select all of the text and change it to use a 12-point font.
	7.	If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.
	8.	In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”. Now, when you Compile, your custom “Contents” document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the “Contents” document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.

Sample Document
See the “Sample MS” PDF file in the Research folder for an example of a document that has been created using this template.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to non-fiction authors. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template.</Text>

            <Text>Patterns and Drivers of Industrialization
The Industrial Revolution, starting roughly in late-18th-century Britain, is the locus classicus of the Great Divergence:
	•	Britain led with mechanized textile production, steam power, and coal-based energy. Urbanization accelerated as employment shifted from farming to industry. By 1850, real incomes and productivity diverged sharply from Asian and African economies7.
	•	Continental Europe (France, Germany, Belgium) followed in the 19th century, though with varied speeds and state involvement.

            <Text>Technological Change: Accelerating and Polarizing
	The rapid pace of technological advance is both the greatest opportunity and challenge of the 21st century. Technology is a double-edged sword: essential for productivity, resilience, and progress—yet capable of entrenching inequality and disrupting societies if poorly managed.
	•	Frontier technologies: AI, robotics, IoT, nanotechnology, biotech, and renewable energy can transform productive capacity and life prospects, but their benefits are unequally distributed.
	•	Sustainable development: Rapid innovation is critical for achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but without deliberate policy, it can heighten gaps within and between nations.

Risk/Challenge

Increased consumption, e-waste

Policy implication: Guided investment in human capital and "absorptive capacity" (the ability to adopt and adapt new knowledge) is crucial for nations lagging behind to catch up or leapfrog in development.

	The 20th-century Solow model addresses the limitations of both Malthus and Smith by centering sustained technological progress and relaxing land constraints:
	•	Solow Model: Growth depends on capital accumulation, labor expansion, and, crucially, exogenous technological progress.
	•	Unlike Malthus, in the Solow framework, continuous technology adoption raises both income and population sustainably, allowing for perpetual increases in per capita income if the rate of tech progress exceeds population growth15.

	•	Content: Curricula imported from Europe, often irrelevant to local needs; missionary and private schools established for upper classes; public provision minimal or restricted.
	•	Outcome: Upon independence, many postcolonial societies inherited fragmented, elitist, or biased education systems, impeding equitable social mobility and weakening skills' match to economic needs.
Efforts at reform (expansion, “Africanization,” curriculum reform) met mixed success. The legacy is visible in persistent stratification, skills gaps, and language/cultural tensions</Text>

            <Text>Empirical Patterns: Britain 1500–1800
	Smithian dynamics explain early modern growth spurts seen, for example, in Britain:
	•	Between 1500–1800, division of labour (documented via occupational data and the spread of urban trades) and increased market integration prefigured Britain’s later industrial leap.
	•	Regions with higher market access, urbanization, and trade saw more specialization, higher wages, and greater productivity.

Smithian growth is thus transitional: It paved the way for the Industrial Revolution but did not—and could not—generate the exponential income gains observed post-1800 without further, innovation-driven dynamics.

            <Text>Globalization and Modern Inequality
	Modern globalization is both a legacy and an evolution of colonial dynamics:
	•	Global trade networks established during colonialism survive, with former colonies frequently stuck exporting raw materials or low-value-added goods25.
	•	Cultural globalization continues to be marked by hierarchies established in the colonial period, with Western languages, institutions, and norms dominating international life.
	•	Inequality: The North-South divide, shaped by centuries of extraction and institutional disparity, is now reinforced by technological gaps, capital flows, and trade structures favoring wealthy economies.
Colonial/Postcolonial Mechanism
21st-Century Globalization Result
Resource extraction, plantation economies
Commodity dependency, "trade traps"
Education for elite/bureaucrats
Persistent skills/educational gaps
Cultural suppression
Language loss, marginalization
Divide-and-rule policies
Ethnic conflicts, weak states, authoritarianism

            <Text>The Wage Gap, Consumption, and the Standard of Living
	The real wage (wage/price index) is central to historical livelihoods analysis. Prior to the 19th century, real wage trends (corrected for cost of basic subsistence) reflect stagnation and crisis. The Industrial Revolution saw real wages in Britain and parts of NW Europe rise tenfold by the 20th century, while those in most of Asia and Africa remained flat—manifesting and sharpening the Great Divergence.

Wage data (silver and grain wages) show that while some regions (Yangzi Delta, South India) approached NW European standards for a time, only Northwestern Europe maintained—and then accelerated—gains after 1800
