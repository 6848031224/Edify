## What is Edify

Edify is an open-source, browser-based file explorer built to feel native and intuitive. It mirrors the macOS Finder experience—folders-first sorting, icon and list views, breadcrumb navigation, quick look previews, and keyboard support—while remaining lightweight and responsive.

---

## Why Edify

The goal behind Edify was to bridge the gap between web apps and native file browsers. We wanted:

- A familiar interface for users who rely on folder hierarchies and visual cues.
- A minimal, performant codebase that’s easy to extend and maintain.
- Consistent behavior across devices, ensuring mobile usability without compromising desktop layouts.
